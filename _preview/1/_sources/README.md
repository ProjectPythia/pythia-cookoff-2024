## What is it?

Project Pythia invites you to join a Cookbook Cook-off.  [Pythia Cookbooks](https://cookbooks.projectpythia.org) are crowd-sourced collections of advanced, domain-specific tutorials and exemplar workflows, building upon our [Pythia Foundations](https://foundations.projectpythia.org) tutorials. Cookbooks are supported by a rich GitHub-based infrastructure enabling collaborative authoring and automated health-checking to ensure reproducibility.

The Pythia Cook-off will grow the collection of accessible, reusable, and reproducible geoscientific workflows in the Pythia Cookbooks, while broadening the community of user-contributors. We want to create a forum for people to bring their ideas, existing code, or rough notebooks and collaborate on turning them into community Cookbooks.


## Who is this for?

All levels of experience are welcome: from the user who would like a tutorial on Cookbooks to the seasoned Pangeo community member.

Pythia is committed to building an inclusive space that promotes and values diversity. We hope that our platform can represent the diverse voices present in the geoscience community, as we work together to solve global challenges.
